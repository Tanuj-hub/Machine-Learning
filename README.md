# Machine-Learning
This repository consist of few simple but important soft computing project on different algorithm. 
Implimenting these algorithm using inbuilt library is very easy but doing the same without using library is bit challenging and is very much needed in order to
understand the basic concepts behind these algorithm. So all the projects I uploaded here are done without any specific ML algorithm apart from some very basics
like Numpy, Pandas etc.
